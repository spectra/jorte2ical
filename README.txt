jorte2ical.rb
-------------

This is just a quick script to convert schedule_data.csv from Jorte export to
an icalendar file suitable to be imported to my Android phone. It uses Ruby's
CSV library and Icalendar gem (you can get from github.com/icalendar/icalendar
or using RubyGems).

It works for me. Use it at your own risk :-)
